# Creating-and-Accessing-Vectors
As you learned previously, a numerical vector is an ordered collection of numbers. Ordered means that there is a first number, a second number, and so on to the last number. Each number in the vector is called an element. You can create a vector of the following measured heights in centimeters of six people: 171, 192, 183, 177, 154, and 176.
